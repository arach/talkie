# WFKit

> Native workflow editor for Swift. React Flow-like node graphs for macOS and iOS.

WFKit is a SwiftUI library for building visual node-based workflow editors. Zero dependencies, pure Swift.

## Quick Start

```swift
import SwiftUI
import WFKit

struct ContentView: View {
    @State var canvas = CanvasState()

    var body: some View {
        WFWorkflowEditor(state: canvas)
    }
}
```

## Core Types

- `CanvasState` - Observable state container, holds nodes and connections
- `WorkflowNode` - A node with type, title, position, inputs/outputs
- `WFWorkflowEditor` - Main SwiftUI view component
- `NodeType` - Extensible node type definitions (.trigger, .action, .condition, .output, .llm)

## Creating Nodes

```swift
let node = WorkflowNode(
    type: .action,
    title: "Process Data",
    position: CGPoint(x: 200, y: 100)
)
canvas.addNode(node)
```

## Connecting Nodes

```swift
canvas.connect(from: sourceNode, to: targetNode)
canvas.connect(from: node, port: "output1", to: otherNode)
```

## Package Dependency

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/arach/WFKit.git", from: "1.0.0")
```

## Requirements

- iOS 16+ / macOS 13+
- Swift 5.9+
- SwiftUI

## Project Structure

- `Sources/WFKit/` - Main library source
